# Contributing to the walt.id mdoc lib
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the all test cases pass.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-mdoc/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-mdoc/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here is a good bug report as an example: [bug report from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
