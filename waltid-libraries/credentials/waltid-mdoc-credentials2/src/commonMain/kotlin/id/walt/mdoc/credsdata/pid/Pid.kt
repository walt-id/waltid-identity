Further clarification added in this PID Rulebook: This attribute, as well as the optional issuance_date attribute specified in Section 2.6, pertains to the administrative validity period of the PID. It is up to the PID Provider to decide whether a PID has an administrative validity period. However, if present, it in general is different from the technical validity period of a PID. The technical validity period is a mandatory element of all PIDs (and also attestations) in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. It typically is short, a few days or weeks at most, if not shorter, to mitigate challenges regarding tracking of Users by malicious Relying Parties based on the repeated presentation of the same PID. On the other hand, the administrative validity period is typically at least a few years long. During the administrative validity period of a PID, the PID Provider will therefore provide multiple successive PIDs to a User, typically without any actions being expected from the User. However, when the administrative validity period of a PID ends, typically the User has to apply for an entirely new PID. */
