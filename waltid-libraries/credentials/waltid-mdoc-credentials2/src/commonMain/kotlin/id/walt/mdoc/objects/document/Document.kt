/**
 * Represents a single document returned within a `DeviceResponse`. This is the main container
 * for the data elements of a specific credential, such as a Mobile Driving Licence (mDL).
 *
 * It separates data elements into those signed by the issuer and those signed by the mdoc holder's device.
 *
 * @see ISO/IEC 18013-5:xxxx(E), 8.3.2.1.2.3 (Device retrieval mdoc response)
 *
 * @property docType The document type identifier for the credential being presented (e.g., "org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL").
 * @property issuerSigned A mandatory structure containing data elements signed by the issuing authority and the
 * Mobile Security Object (MSO) for their verification.
 * @property deviceSigned A mandatory structure containing data elements signed by the mdoc's device key and the
 * `DeviceAuth` structure for holder authentication. It must be present even if no data elements are returned
 * within it, as `DeviceAuth` is essential for session integrity.
 * @property errors An optional map that reports errors for any requested data elements that could not be returned.
 * The map structure is `Namespace -> (DataElementIdentifier -> ErrorCode)`.
