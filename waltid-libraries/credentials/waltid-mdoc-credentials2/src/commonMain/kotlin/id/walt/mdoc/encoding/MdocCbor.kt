 * - `ignoreUnknownKeys = true`: For forward compatibility.
 * - `encodeDefaults = true`: Important for creating canonical representations for signing.
 * - `alwaysUseByteString = true`: Ensures all `ByteArray` properties are encoded as CBOR
 * byte strings (major type 2) instead of arrays of integers, as required by the spec.
