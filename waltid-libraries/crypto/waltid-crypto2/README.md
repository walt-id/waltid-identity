## ⚠️ Work in Progress

**This library is currently under active development and is not intended for use by external developers.**

The API, functionality, and structure are subject to change without notice. This library is for internal use only while it's being developed and refined.

## What This Library Contains

`waltid-crypto2` is a next-generation cryptography library for walt.id, designed to provide modern cryptographic primitives with improved APIs and multiplatform support. Currently, the library focuses on hashing functionality with plans to expand to other cryptographic operations.

## Main Purpose

This library is being developed to:

- Provide modern, multiplatform cryptographic primitives
- Offer improved APIs compared to the original `waltid-crypto` library
- Support both stateless and stateful hashing operations
- Enable suspend-friendly (coroutine) operations
- Serve as a foundation for future cryptographic functionality

## Current Features

- **Hashing Algorithms**: Support for SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512
- **Stateless Hashing**: One-shot hash computation via `Hash` interface
- **Stateful Hashing**: Incremental hashing via `Digest` interface
- **Multiplatform**: JVM support (with plans for additional platforms)
- **Coroutine Support**: Suspend-friendly async operations
