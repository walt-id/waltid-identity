# walt.id Identity Docker Environment

This directory contains the Docker Compose configuration that sets up and runs the services and applications of the
walt.id Identity Stack.
You can either run the latest release using pre-built Docker images or build your images locally.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker]()
- [Docker Compose]()

---

## Quick Start with Latest Release Images

If you prefer to run the services using latest release pre-built Docker images, follow these steps:

### Pull the Latest Release Images

Start by pulling the latest release Docker images for the services:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

This ensures that you're using the most recent release images from the Docker registry.

### Start the Services

Once the images are pulled, start the services by running:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

*Note:* If you are facing issues with the containers, try running the following command to remove the existing
containers and then run the
above command again.

### Stop the Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Tear down the Services

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

*Note:*
The version of the images pulled is controlled by the `VERSION_TAG` in the `.env` file. By default, it is set to latest,
which pulls the most recent release of the Docker images.
If you prefer to use a specific version, such as a past release, modify the `VERSION_TAG` in the `.env` file before
pulling the images.

## Building and Running Services Locally

### Update the VERSION_TAG

Before building locally, ensure the correct version is specified in the `.env` file.
Update the `VERSION_TAG` variable to the desired version value for the local build.

### Build the Docker Images Locally

Once the `VERSION_TAG` is set, build the Docker images based on your local changes by running:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Start the Services

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Starting services selectively

It is possible to start services selectively, including their dependencies.

#### Start the demo wallet and all dependant services

```console
docker compose up waltid-demo-wallet
```

will start automatically:

- caddy
- postgres
- wallet-api
- and waltid-web-wallet

#### Start services using compose profiles

`COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable located in the .env file allows the selection of
profiles to start the services for. Currently, the services are available with 2 profiles:

- identity - for the waltid-identity services
- tse - for the Hashicorp vault service, will be initialized with:
    - a transit secrets engine
    - and authentication methods
        - approle - for my-role, where role-id and secret-id will be output in the console<sup>1</sup>
        - userpass - for myuser with mypassword
        - access-token - with dev-only-token
- opa - for the Open Policy Agent service

Profiles can be combined, e.g. `COMPOSE_PROFILES=identity,tse` - will start the
waltid-identity services and the vault (also can be done with the `all` profile).

<sup>1</sup> - example output:

```console
vault-init            | Role ID: 66f3f095-74c9-b270-9d1f-1f842aa6bf3f
vault-init            | Secret ID: 3abf1e00-2dc1-9e77-0705-9a81a95c7c59
```

### Stop the Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Tear down the Services

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Port mapping

### Services

- Wallet API: [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001)
- Issuer API: [http://localhost:7002](http://localhost:7002)
- Verifier API: [http://localhost:7003](http://localhost:7003)
- Hashicorp vault: [http://localhost:8200](http://localhost:8200)
- Open Policy Agent: [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181)

### Apps

- Demo Web Wallet: [http://localhost:7101](http://localhost:7101)
- Dev Web Wallet: [http://localhost:7104](http://localhost:7104)
- Web Portal: [http://localhost:7102](http://localhost:7102)
- Credential Repo: [http://localhost:7103](http://localhost:7103)

## Configurations

- wallet API:
    - `wallet-api/config` - wallet configuration
- issuer API:
    - `issuer-api/config`
- verifier API:
    - `verifier-api/config`
- ingress:
    - `Caddyfile`

[//]: # (## Environment)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (- main:)

[//]: # (    - `.env` - stores the common environment variables, such as port numbers,)

[//]: # (      version-tag, database-engine selection, etc.)

[//]: # (- postgres:)

[//]: # (    - `postgres/postgres.env` - stores postgres specific variables, e.g. admin user, etc.)

[//]: # (    - `pgadmin.env` - stores pgAdmin specific variables, e.g. admin user, etc.)

[//]: # (- microsoft sql-server:)

[//]: # (    - `mssql/mssql.env` - stores mssql specific variables, e.g. sql-server edition, etc.)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (Variables from `.env` are propagated automatically down to reverse proxy configurations)

[//]: # (&#40;Caddyfile&#41; and also api configurations &#40;wallet, issuer, verifier&#41;.)

## How to

[//]: # (### Select a database engine)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (- browse `.env` file)

[//]: # (- set `DATABASE_ENGINE` to one of:)

[//]: # (    - sqlite)

[//]: # (    - postgres)

[//]: # (    - mssql)

This value will be used also by compose profile so only the required services are started.

### Update port number

- browse `.env` file
- update the desired port number

This value will be used by reverse proxy (and services configs, if any).

### Select an identity stack version

- browse `.env` file
- update `VERSION_TAG` to a specific image version (e.g. a release version)
    - if not set, `latest` tag is used

## Troubleshooting

#### Updating ports doesn't work

Make sure the ports are also updated in:

- Caddyfile
- issuer-api/config
    - issuer-service.conf
    - web.conf
- verifier-api/config
    - verifier-service.conf
    - web.conf
- wallet-api/config
    - web.conf
    - db.conf

#### Removing the DB volume

```
docker volume rm docker-compose_wallet-api-db
```

#### DB Backup / Restore

```
pg_dump -U your_user_name -h your_host -d your_db_name > backup.sql
psql -U your_user_name -h your_host -d your_db_name < backup.sql
```
