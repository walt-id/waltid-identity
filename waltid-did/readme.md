## Getting started

_**walt.id did**_ library provides functionality for registering and resolving DIDs.
There are 2 options offered for each function:
- universal - relies on the universal DID registrar / resolver, e.g.:
  - uni-registrar - https://uniregistrar.io
  - uni-resolver - https://dev.uniresolver.io
- local - provides local implementations of DID methods

For the cryptographic part, _**walt.id did**_ library relies on _**walt.id crypto**_ library.

## Class diagram

The top-level interface to access the registrar / resolver functions is provided
by the `DidService` singleton.

## Usage examples

### Register DID
Create the key and register the Did:
```kotlin
val options = DidWebCreateOptions(
    domain = "localhost:3000",
    path = "/path/to/did.json",
    keyType = KeyType.Ed25519
)
val didResult = DidService.register(options = options)
```

Register the Did with the given key:
```kotlin
val key = LocalKey.generate(KeyType.Ed25519)
val options = DidKeyCreateOptions(
  useJwkJcsPub = true
)
val didResult = DidService.register(
    method = "key",
    key = key,
    options = options
)
```

Both calls return a `DidResult` object:
```kotlin
data class DidResult(
    val did: String,
    val didDocument: DidDocument
)
```
where `did` - is the Did url string, while `didDocument` is the corresponding
DidDocument represented as a key-value pair, having the key as a `String` and 
value as a `JsonElement`.

Currently available local did methods are:
`key`, `web`, `jwk`.

Currently available universal did methods are:
`btcr`, `cheqd`, `ebsi`, `ethr`, `ion`, `jwk`, `key`,
`oyd`, `sov`, `v1`, `web`.

### Resolve DID

Resolve the Did url to a Did Document:

```kotlin
val did = "did:web:localhost:3000"
val didDocumentResult = DidService.resolve(did = did)
val document = didDocumentResult.getOrNull()
```

Resolve the Did url to its public Key:

```kotlin
val did = "did:key:zmYg9bgKmRiCqTTd9MA1ufVE9tfzUptwQp4GMRxptXquJWw4Uj5cqKBi2vyiwwxC3v7ixvJ8SB9DvDdrK7UemySWDPhvHhUcZ7pgtZtFchLtzK4YC"
val keyResult = DidService.resolveToKey(did = did)
val key = keyResult.getOrNull()
```

Both calls return the result using the _operation result pattern_,
the data being wrapped by the `Result` object. This allows checking for
a successful operation and handling the result accordingly.

The Did Document data is represented as `JsonObject`. The key data is 
represented as **_walt.id crypto_** `Key`.
